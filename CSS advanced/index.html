            <p>The Apollo 11 Saturn V lifted off from the Kennedy Space centre at 09:36 on 16 July 1969 carrying three
                astronauts, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin. The journey to the Moon would last
                4
                days,
                6 hours and 45 minutes, finally landing on 20 July 1969.</p>

            <h2>The astronauts encountered some problems before landing</h2>
            <p>The journey to the Moon was not all plain sailing though. Before landing, a series of alarm messages
                sounded
                that
                none of the astronauts had previously heard. The alarms were caused by 'executive overflows' as a result
                of
                the
                guidance computer not being able to complete all of its tasks and having to postpone some of them. After
                checking the alarm, computer technicians on the ground reassured the crew that is was safe to land.
                However, that was not to be the last of the problems the crew would face. Radio communication loss
                between
                the
                lunar module and mission control meant the mission was close to being aborted. Despite Aldrin adjusting
                the
                antenna and ground control attempting to resolve the issue, radio communications continued to fade in
                and
                out.

            <h2>The astronauts did not land at their planned site</h2>
            <p>No sooner than one problem was resolved, another reared its head. Due to the gravity of the Moon and some
                extra
                speed gained, Armstrong and Aldrin had missed the landing site by about 4 miles and were instead faced
                an
                unfriendly sight of rough terrain and lorry-sized craters. Armstrong had to find a smooth spot to land,
                and
                fastâ€¦
